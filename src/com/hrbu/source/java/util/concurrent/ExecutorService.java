/**
 * An {@link Executor} that provides methods to manage termination and
 * methods that can produce a {@link Future} for tracking progress of one or more asynchronous tasks.
 * 一个{@link Executor}，它提供了一些方法来管理终止，以及一些方法可以生成一个{@link Future}来跟踪一个或多个异步任务的进度。
 *
 * <p>An {@code ExecutorService} can be shut down, which will cause it to reject new tasks.
 * 可以关闭{@code ExecutorService}，这会导致它拒绝新任务。
 * Two different methods are provided for shutting down an {@code ExecutorService}.
 * The {@link #shutdown} method will allow previously submitted tasks to execute before terminating,
 * while the {@link #shutdownNow} method prevents waiting tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently executing tasks.
 * 在ExectorService中提供了两个不同的方法来关闭。shutdown方法允许在终止之前执行先前提交的任务，而shutdownNow方法阻止正在等待的任务启动，并试图停止正在执行的任务。
 * Upon termination, an executor has no tasks actively executing, no tasks awaiting execution, and no new tasks can be submitted.
 * 当执行器终止时，没有正在执行的任务，没有等待执行的任务，也没有新的任务可以提交。
 * An unused {@code ExecutorService} should be shut down to allow reclamation of its resources.
 * 应该关闭未使用的{@code ExecutorService}，以允许其资源的回收。
 *
 * <p>Method {@code submit} extends base method {@link Executor#execute(Runnable)} by creating
 * and returning a {@link Future} that can be used to cancel execution and/or wait for completion.
 * submit方法扩展了{@link Executor#execute(Runnable)}基本方法，回一个{@link Future}，可以用来取消执行和/或等待完成。
 * Methods {@code invokeAny} and {@code invokeAll} perform the most commonly useful forms of bulk execution,
 * executing a collection of tasks and then waiting for at least one, or all, to complete.
 *
 * (Class {@link ExecutorCompletionService} can be used to write customized variants of these methods.)
 * {@link ExecutorCompletionService}可用于编写这些方法的自定义变体。
 *
 * <p>The {@link Executors} class provides factory methods for the executor services provided in this package.
 * Executors类为这个包中提供的executor服务提供工厂方法。
 *
 * <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 *
 * Here is a sketch of a network service in which threads in a thread
 * pool service incoming requests. It uses the preconfigured {@link
 * Executors#newFixedThreadPool} factory method:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class NetworkService implements Runnable {
 *   private final ServerSocket serverSocket;
 *   private final ExecutorService pool;
 *
 *   public NetworkService(int port, int poolSize)
 *       throws IOException {
 *     serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
 *     pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
 *   }
 *
 *   public void run() { // run the service
 *     try {
 *       for (;;) {
 *         pool.execute(new Handler(serverSocket.accept()));
 *       }
 *     } catch (IOException ex) {
 *       pool.shutdown();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * class Handler implements Runnable {
 *   private final Socket socket;
 *   Handler(Socket socket) { this.socket = socket; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     // read and service request on socket
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * The following method shuts down an {@code ExecutorService} in two phases,
 * first by calling {@code shutdown} to reject incoming tasks, and then
 * calling {@code shutdownNow}, if necessary, to cancel any lingering tasks:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * void shutdownAndAwaitTermination(ExecutorService pool) {
 *   pool.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted
 *   try {
 *     // Wait a while for existing tasks to terminate
 *     if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
 *       pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks
 *       // Wait a while for tasks to respond to being cancelled
 *       if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
 *           System.err.println("Pool did not terminate");
 *     }
 *   } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
 *     // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted
 *     pool.shutdownNow();
 *     // Preserve interrupt status
 *     Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to the
 * submission of a {@code Runnable} or {@code Callable} task to an
 * {@code ExecutorService}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * any actions taken by that task, which in turn <i>happen-before</i> the
 * result is retrieved via {@code Future.get()}.
 *
 * @since 1.5
